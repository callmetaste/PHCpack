Static lifting for mixed volumes and polyhedral continuation in PHCv2.4.06

In release 2.3, one file had to be changed for the optimizer in Mac OS X
and default options were set to floating-point point-wise lifting.
Release 2.3.16 has new facilities to jumpstart the polyhedral homotopies,
along with an exponential continuation parameter.  
The direct input of Laurent systems led to changes in release 2.3.26.
Support for stable mixed volumes was added in release 2.3.31.
In release 2.3.90, versions of polyhedral homotopies in double double
and quad double precision were provided.

The algorithm used is based on the construction of a mixed subdivision,
based on Betke's formula for mixed volumes and the polyhedral homotopy
continuation methods developed by Huber and Sturmfels.

This library features integer-valued and floating-point lifting functions.
The implementation of integer static lifting typically induces nested
subdivisions, with non-fine cells recursively refined by subdivisions.

In version 2.4.06, the application of heterogeneous multitasking 
makes that the MixedVol algorithm runs in parallel with the polyhedral
path trackers to solve a random coefficient system.

There are four parts in this library:

1. Integer-valued lifting, mixed subdivisions and polyhedral continuation
2. Floating-point lifting, mixed subdivisions and polyhedral continuation
3. Influence of points to mixed volume: a simple criterion
4. Driver packages

Subdivisions induced by integer lifting functions have to be recursive,
since one cannot guarantee that all cells will be fine mixed.
