-- DESCRIPTION :
--   Provides a gateway from C to the Littlewood-Richardson homotopies.

-- ON ENTRY :
--   job =  0 : given in a the dimension of a general Schubert problem:
--              a[0] : the ambient dimension n of the space,
--              a[1] : the dimension k of the solution planes,
--              a[2] : the number c of intersection conditions,
--              and in a[3] is the verbose flag, 0 for silent, 1 for output;
--              in b are the brackets, as many integers as the dimension k
--              of the solution planes times c, the number of conditions.
--       =  1 : runs the Littlewood-Richardson homotopies on a generic,
--              randomly generated set of flags, in standard double precision,
--              with inputs:
--              a[0] : the ambient dimension n of the space,
--              a[1] : the dimension k of the solution planes,
--              a[2] : the number c of intersection conditions,
--              a[3] : indicates the monitoring of the homotopies,
--              a[4] : indicates the verification of the homotopies,
--              a[5] : number of characters in the file name;
--              in b are the brackets, as many integers as the dimension k
--              of the solution planes times c, the number of conditions;
--              in c are the characters of the name of the output file;
--       =  2 : runs the Littlewood-Richardson homotopies on a generic,
--              randomly generated set of flags, in double double precision,
--              with inputs:
--              a[0] : the ambient dimension n of the space,
--              a[1] : the dimension k of the solution planes,
--              a[2] : the number c of intersection conditions,
--              a[3] : indicates the monitoring of the homotopies,
--              a[4] : indicates the verification of the homotopies,
--              a[5] : number of characters in the file name;
--              in b are the brackets, as many integers as the dimension k
--              of the solution planes times c, the number of conditions;
--              in c are the characters of the name of the output file;
--       =  3 : runs the Littlewood-Richardson homotopies on a generic,
--              randomly generated set of flags, in quad double precision,
--              with inputs:
--              a[0] : the ambient dimension n of the space,
--              a[1] : the dimension k of the solution planes,
--              a[2] : the number c of intersection conditions,
--              a[3] : indicates the monitoring of the homotopies,
--              a[4] : indicates the verification of the homotopies,
--              a[5] : number of characters in the file name;
--              in b are the brackets, as many integers as the dimension k
--              of the solution planes times c, the number of conditions;
--              in c are the characters of the name of the output file.

-- ON RETURN :
--   0 if the operation was successful, otherwise something went wrong,
--   e.g.: job not in the right range.
