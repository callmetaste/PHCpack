Homotopies, Newton's method and path trackers in PHCv2.4.13

This directory was newly created in version 2.3.75, collecting the
directories Homotopy, Newton, and Continuation.  The directory Continuation
was further subdivided into End_Games, Trackers, Sweep, and Continuation.
The directory Curves was added in version 2.3.79.
