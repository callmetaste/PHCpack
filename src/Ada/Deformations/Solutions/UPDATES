Tue 17 Nov 2015 : versions for double double and quad double precision of
  the solution_splitters, in {dobldobl, quaddobl}_solution_splitters.

Wed 7 Oct 2015 : fixed ts_grepsols.adb for code that was factored out of
  the drivers_for_condition_tables.

Tue 29 Sep 2015 : new packages {dobldobl,quaddobl}_solution_filters to filter
  solutions given in double double and quad double precision, with drivers in
  drivers_for_solution_filters, tested by ts_solfilt and called by mainfilt.

Mon 28 Sep 2015 : new packages {dobldobl,quaddobl}_point_lists,
  tested by ts_ptlists, and new packages {dobldobl,quaddobl}_quad_trees,
  tested by ts_quadpart.  Factored code of the drivers_for_condition_tables
  into standard_select_solutions, new packages *dobl_select_solutions,
  tested by ts_selsol.  This changes also mainfilt.adb, ts_quad.db.
  New packages *dobl_solution_diagnostics, *dobl_condition_{tables,report},
  called by drivers_for_condition_tables.

Thu 24 Sep 2015 : to {dobldobl,quaddobl}_complex_solutions, added a push
  procedure to insert a list of solutions to the front of another list.

Mon 29 Dec 2014 : extended standard_solution_strings with write functions
  to string for variable precision use.  Be careful with one variable case!

Thu 25 Dec 2014 : new package solution_string_splitters tested by ts_solstr.

Sun 7 Dec 2014 : new package varbprec_complex_solutions to convert solutions
  over various levels of precision.

Tue 26 Aug 2014 : extended {dobl,quad}dobl_complex_solutions_io with output
  routines for the diagnostics of a solution.

Fri 20 Jun 2014 : proper adjustment of multiplicity field in the procedure
  Multiplicity of standard_condition_report.

Thu 19 Jun 2014 : insert with duplicates in standard_point_lists is extended
  with extra parameter for the position of the added point.

Wed 18 Jun 2014 : added another insert to standard_point_lists for use
  in the Multiplicity of standard_condition_report.

Tue 17 Jun 2014 : added insert routines to standard_point_lists,
  tested with ts_ptlists.  Added more efficient Is_Clustered to
  the package standard_condition_report.

Thu 29 May 2014 : changed {standard,dobldobl,quaddobl,multprec}_complex_
  solutions_io.adb to remove all compiler warnings.

Wed 28 May 2014 : changed {standard,dobldobl,quaddobl,multprec}_complex_
  solutions_io.adb for compiler warnings.

Fri 29 Nov 2013 : changed copy of multprec_complex_solutions.adb 
  and fixed a bug in the copy of lists of multiprecision solutions,
  which occurred while upgrading ts_extrapol to multiprecision.

Thu 27 Jun 2013 : updated drivers_for_solution_filters.adb for a warning.

Wed 26 Jun 2013 : updated mainfilt.adb for natural32 data type.

Tue 25 Jun 2013 : standard_solution_splitters got updated with integer32.

Wed 12 Jun 2013 : updated {dobldobl,quaddobl}_systems_and_solutions_io.adb.

Mon 10 Jun 2013 : copied lists_of_symbols from ../Homotopy to here
  and completed reorganzation for all ts_ files.

Sun 9 Jun 2013 : about half of the files in this directory changed
  because of the introduction of natural32 and integer32 types.

Fri 10 May 2013 : new package standard_condition_report to avoid the
  confusion in drivers_for_condition_tables, tested by ts_quad.adb,
  also additions to standard_select_solutions.

Thu 9 May 2013 : copied from ../Homotopy the standard_point_lists.a*
  because there are needed by standard_quad_trees.
  Modified ts_selsol.adb to allow for interactive input of indices.
  New package standard_select_solutions, used in ts_quad.adb.
  Copied from ../Homotopy the mainfilt.a* and modified mainfilt.adb,
  because of changes in drivers_for_condition_tables.
  Also ts_grepsols.adb changed.

Fri 15 Feb 2013 : the parse operations in *_solution_strings* now
  initialize the symbol table.

Thu 14 Feb 2013 : new package solution_drops tested by ts_soldrop.

Fri 1 Feb 2013 : fixed bug in dobldobl_solution_strings.adb,
  the same bug appeared in quadobl_solution_strings.adb.

Tue 29 Jan 2013 : multprec_solution_strings.adb got fixed.
  New packages {dobldobl,quaddobl}_solution_strings, tested by ts_solstr.

Mon 28 Jan 2013 : changed standard_solution_strings.ads, new package
  multprec_solution_strings, tested by ts_solstr.adb.

Sun 20 Jan 2013 : created this new directory from code of Homotopy:
  all that concerns the representation of solutions.
