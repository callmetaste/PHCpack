  the "phc -k" is now operational.

Tue 31 Aug 2004 : created mainfeed and changed dispatch.adb to allow
  the ts_feedback.c to be called as "phc -k".

Thu 26 Aug 2004 : changed an "in out" in bablphc.adb to an "out".

Thu 22 Jul 2004 : updated bablphc.adb so that bablsolve is called for
  nonsquare systems, added mainsolve to dispatch.adb, adjusted mainphc
  to add the extra option -a to phc command line.

Fri 25 Jun 2004 : mainvali.adb uses a new driver, dispatch.adb adjusted.

Sun 20 Jun 2004 : mainvali.adb has new 6th option, which calls Newton
  with deflation, also adjusted dispatch.adb to mark the date.

Wed 9 Jun 2004 : changed mainvali.adb to have only multiprecision roots
  following the main banner.

Sun 6 Jun 2004 : changed dispatch.adb elevating v2.3 to beta status...

Thu 3 Jun 2004 : changed mainzip.adb to deal with multiprecision.

Tue 11 May 2004 : changed bablphc.adb for factors to be written
  on separate files, after change in Black_Box_Factorization.

Fri 5 Mar 2004 : changed mainzip.adb so that result is appended to
  an existing output file.

Wed 3 Mar 2004 : changed mainzip.adb to convert solutions from Maple
  to PHCpack format.

Sat 28 Feb 2004 : changed dispatch.adb to add -b option to -e.

Fri 27 Feb 2004 : rewrote dispatch.adb to allow for three file names
  in the command line of phc; also changed bablphc.adb.

Wed 10 Sep 2003 : the black-box solver now first tests whether
  a polynomial system is fewnomial or not and if so, solves it
  really fast.  This was needed to fix a bug on an embarrassingly
  simply example...

Mon 18 Aug 2003 : the black-box solver can now treat single polynomials,
  either by calling Durand-Kerner (in the case of one variable)
  or by numerical factorization (in the case of more than one variable).

Wed 16 Jul 2003 : changed welcome banner in dispatch.adb

****************** updates since release 2.2 alpha ***************

Changed black_box_root_counting.ads to deal with semi-mixed inputs
on Sun June 13, 1999.  Copied to the public distribution directory.

Mon June 14, 1999: assignment to roco in black_box_root_counting.
  Also changed bablphc.adb because p.all as variable does not seem
  all that right to me.  Copied files to the public distribution.

Tue 10 August, 1999: change in bablphc due to change in
  Black_Polynomial_Continuations.  In Black_Box_Root_Counting,
  changed the "in out" type of the file simply to "in".

Sat 14 August 1999 : Copied black_box_root_counting.ads and .adb to
  the public distribution directory.
  Copied bablphc.adb to the public distribution directory.

Mon 4 January 2000 : added components as one of the options in
  dispatch.adb and changed the list in mainphc.adb.

Thu 27 April 2000 : extra flag in Black_Box_Root_Counting to use
  only degrees to count the roots.  This affects bablphc and bablroco.

Wed 31 May 2000 : due to modified Newton's method in the root refiner,
  changed bablvali.adb, mainvali.adb, and driver_for_root_refining.adb.

Fri 15 Sep 2000 : changed mainphc.adb to use the "Write_Elapsed_Time" from
  Time_Stamps to obtain a nicer format; also changed bablphc.adb.

Thu 24 May 2001 : changed mainphc.adb as a consequence of changes to the
  drivers to polynomial continuation for multi-precision continuation.

Thu 19 July 2001 : fixed status error exception in the blackbox solver
  of phc when there is no input file; changed file bablphc.adb.
  Fixed driver_for_own_start_system.adb, did not read in the number of
  equations, which caused a fatal exception.
  Added mainzip.ads and mainzip.adb, after changing the files dispatch.adb
  and mainphc.adb, so that now phc returns the solutions in a format
  accessible to Maple.

Fri 20 July 2001 : extra option "-f" in phc to factor pure dimensional
  solution sets into irreducible components; changed dispatch.adb and
  mainphc.adb.
  The black_box_root_counting.adb did no longer execute the product
  root count in case deg was set to false.

Thu 20 Sep 2001 : write_start_system added to driver_to_root_counts.adb
  added -t as one of the options to phc, changed dispatch.adb.

Sun 30 Sep 2001 : adjusted mainphc.adb to display also -t as one of the
  options.

Thu 21 Mar 2002 : changed black_box_root_couting.ads and .adb to deal
  with zero mixed volumes

Fri 22 Mar 2002 : changed bablphc.adb so that the solutions are added
  to the input file when the file name is on the command line and when
  no solutions field is in the input file

Sun 31 Mar 2002 : added exception handler to black_box_root_counting.adb
  to deal with system with one monomial equations

Tue 9 Apr 2002 : no black-box mixed-volume computation for systems with
  more than 10 equations.  It simply takes too long.

Tue 25 June 2002 : updated phcpack with some extra routines and made sure
  that use_phc works again.

Tue 30 July 2002 : scaling -> standard_scaling: changed bablphc.adb and
  driver_for_root_refining.adb
