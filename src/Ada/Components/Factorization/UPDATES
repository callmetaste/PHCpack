Mon 28 Dec 2015 : minor improvement in homotopy_membership_tests.adb.

Fri 25 Dec 2015 : changed mainfac.adb to explain the input in the membership
  test of phc -f.  Added extra procedures to homotopy_membership_tests,
  tested by ts_mbthom.adb.

Sun 20 Sep 2015 : extended black_box_factorization into a package with versions
  for double double and quad double precision.

Sat 19 Sep 2015 : change in ts_factor.adb for compiler warning and removed
  code from ts_factor.adb that was already in drivers_to_factor_polynomials.

Fri 18 Sep 2015 : multivariate_factorization exports the factorization of
  complex multivariate polynomials in double double and quad double precision,
  with the combinatorial exploration using the linear trace.
  Extended monodromy_polynomial_breakup with factorization procedures to run
  in standard double, double double, and quad double precision arithmetic.
  Updated multivariate_factorization with extended monodromy poly breakup.
  The new routines are called in the updated drivers_to_factor_polynomials,
  and in mainfac.adb.

Thu 17 Sep 2015 : new package factored_witness_vectors with code factored out
  of multivariate_factorization.adb, extended with operations for double
  double and quad double precision.  The new package certify_factor_with_trace
  extracts code of multivariate_factorization, extended to work with
  double double and quad double arithmetic.  In similar fashion, the new
  package interpolate_multivariate_factor extracts code from the package
  multivariate_factorization, for extension to double doubles and quad doubles.
  The move of Normalize() from multivariate_factorization to this new package
  changed drivers_to_factor_polynomials.adb and ts_factor.adb.

Wed 16 Sep 2015 : edits in multivariate_factorization to make room to extend
  the package for double double and quad double precision.

Mon 14 Sep 2015 : changes in multivariate_factorization.adb and
  monodromy_polynomial_breakup.adb for the new standard_lined_hypersurfaces.

Sat 9 Aug 2014 : upgraded drivers_to_factor_components with procedures to
  call the monodromy factorization in double double and quad double precision.
  The main driver mainfac exports factorization as options 8 and 9,
  respectively in double double and quad double precision.

Fri 1 Aug 2014 : extended combinatorial_factorization to operate on samples
  in double double and quad double precision, tested by ts_combfac.adb.
  Extended monodromy_partitions and monodromy_component_breakup to run
  in double double and quad double precision, tested by ts_newfac.adb.

Mon 24 Mar 2014 : mainfac.adb adjusted so membership homotopy test
  enabled for double double and quad double precision.

Sun 23 Mar 2014 : updated homotopy_membership_tests with routines for
  double double and quad double precision, with changed ts_mbthom.adb.

Wed 26 Jun 2013 : updated drivers_to_factor_components and
  drivers_to_factor_polynomials as need in mainfac.adb.

Mon 24, Tue 25 2013 : more reorganization to rebuilt ts_irco.
  Copied ts_mbthom.adb from ../Decomposition to this directory,
  because homotopy membership test is historically related to monodromy.

Fri 21 Jun 2013 : because of natural32 and integer32, updated ts_monfac,
  monodromy_partitions, combinatorial_factorization, ts_combfac...

Tue 1 Jan 2013 : ts_monfac.adb no longer compiled, fixed...

Sun 30 Dec 2012 : sensitivity_of_factorization.adb no longer compiled,
  fixed.

Thu 2 Jun 2011 : changed ts_combfac.adb, ts_factor.adb, ts_ifactor.adb,
  ts_hypfac.adb for warnings.

Wed 1 Jun 2011 : changed combinatorial_factorization.adb,
  drivers_to_factor_{polynomials,components}.adb for warnings.

Sun 29 May 2011 : too many warnings for irreducible_component_creators.adb
  to be fixed in one time...  Modified homotopy_membership_tests.* for warnings.

Mon 2 May 2011 : fixed ts_ifactor.adb because it no longer compiled.

Fri 24 Sep 2010 : updated mainfac.adb because of string_splitters.

Tue 28 Jul 2009 : extended mainfac.adb with 7th option.

Sun 29 Apr 2007 : fixed homotopy_membership_tests.adb so that eventually
  test solutions may have already an embedding.

Sat 28 Apr 2007 : the user can now control the tolerances in membership test,
  changed mainfac.adb.  Copied homotopy_membership_tests from ../Decomposition.

Thu 14 Dec 2006 : because witness_points* became *sets*, mainfac.adb changed;
  also drivers_to_factor_components.adb, irreducible_component_lists.adb,
  monodromy_component_breakup.adb, monodromy_actions_breakup.adb, ts_ifactor,
  ts_combfac, ts_irco, driver_to_factor_components.adb, ts_rwpoly, ts_newfac
  changed.  ts_monfac.adb seems obsolete...

Tue 12 Dec 2006 : updated monodromy_polynomial_breakup.adb because renamed
  lists_of_complex_vectors into standard_complex_veclists.

Thu 15 Jun 2006 : updated mainfac.adb because standard_complex_solutions.get
  has become obsolete.

Wed 14 Jun 2006 : because of warnings on AIX, changed the files
  irreducible_component_lists.a* and irreducible_component_creators.adb.

Fri 12 May 2006 : added option #0 to phc -f to filter solution lists,
  subject to criteria provided by the user.

Tue 10 Jan 2006 : removed old_driver* from mainfac.adb, allowed user to tune
  the continuation parameters in the driver_to_factor_components.adb.

Tue 6 Sep 2005 : added "Trace_Sum_Difference" to monodromy_component_breakup.

Thu 24 Jun 2004 : monodromy with intrinsic coordinates entered

Tue 8 Jun 2004 : changed drivers_to_factor_components and mainfac.adb
  to create separate files for witness sets of factors.

Tue 11 May 2004 : blackbox factorization writes factors
  to separate files

Mon 25 Aug 2003 : black_box_factorization has been added,
  multivariate_factorization.adb slightly modified.

Fri 23 May 2003 : changed ts_factor and ts_hypfac so that they use
  standard_random_polynomials instead of random_complex_polynomials.
  The latter package should disappear...
