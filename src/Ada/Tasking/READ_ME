Multitasking linear algebra, evaluation and path tracking in PHCv2.4.03

This directory is entirely new in release 2.3.45 of PHCpack.
Tasks in Ada are mapped to kernel threads.

Version 2.3.56 released test programs to time the performance of
multithreaded linear system solving and polynomial evaluation,
described in the paper with Genady Yoffe on
on "Polynomial Homotopies on Multicore Workstations" 
published in the proceedings of PASCO 2010.

An important side effect of this paper is the realization that the evaluation
of a polynomial system and all its derivatives can be performed much faster
than when evaluated as separated polynomials (even with nested Horner).
In v2.3.69, this code was moved to the new directory Functions.

Release 2.3.78 offered a new multithreaded implementation
of polyhedral homotopies.  New in release 2.3.79 are the
multitasking root refiners.
