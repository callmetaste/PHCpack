-- DESCRIPTION :
--   A pipeline of producing and processing cells consists in running
--   the MixedVol Algorithm with a callback function by one tasks.
--   The other tasks are processing the cells.

  function Mixture ( r : integer32;
                     mtype : in Standard_Integer_Vectors.Link_to_Vector )
                   return Standard_Integer_Vectors.Vector;

  -- DESCRIPTION :
  --   Returns the type of mixture as a vector where the entries
  --   start the count at one, instead of at zero as in mtype.

  -- DESCRIPTION :
  --   This code is executed by task with identification number
  --   equal to idtask.  The labels to the mixed cells are converted
  --   into mixed cells and stored in a mixed cell configuration.

  -- ON ENTRY :
  --   idtask   identification number of the task;

  --   perm     permutation used to permute the supports;
  --   vtx      coordinates of the vertex points;
  --   lft      lifting values for the vertex points.

  -- ON RETURN :
  --   mcc      the mixed cells processed by task with id idtask;
  --   process  optional callback procedure to process each mixed
  --            cell as soon as it is computed.
