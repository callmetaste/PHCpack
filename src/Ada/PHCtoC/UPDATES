Mon 14 Dec 2015 : name changes in solcon changed {ade,gpu}newton_d.cpp,
  {ada,gpu}onepath_d.cpp, and {ade,gpu}manypaths_d.cpp.

Tue 22 Sep 2015 : name changes in syscon caused updates in adenewton_d.cpp,
  adeonepath_d.cpp, ademanypaths_d.cpp, gpunewton_d.cp, gpuonepath_d.cpp,
  gpumanypaths_d.cpp; also modified adenewton_dd.cpp, adenewton_qd.cpp,
  and ademanypaths_dd.cpp.

Thu 3 Sep 2015 : used verbose option in gpu_newton_{d,dd,qd}.cpp.

Wed 2 Sep 2015 : updated gpuonepath_qd.cpp for bug fix.

Sun 30 Aug 2015 : separated header files gpunewton_{d,dd,qd}.h,
  separated from gpunewton_{d,dd,qd}.cpp.

Sat 29 Aug 2015 : updated ad hoc interface in ts_gpuonepath_qd.adb.

Fri 28 Aug 2015 : added gamma constant as input parameter to the
  adeonepath_{d,dd,qd} and ademanypaths_{d,dd,qd} routines, and
  updated the {standard,dobldobl,quaddobl}_algodiffeval_trackers
  along with the test programs ts_adepath_{d,dd,qd}.
  Also updated the GPU versions with the gamma constant, leading to changes
  in gpuonepath_{d,dd,qd}, gpumanypaths_{d,dd,qd}, and
  {standard,dobldobl,quaddobl}_accelerated_trackers, with updates
  in ts_gpupath_{d,dd,qd}.

Tue 25 Aug 2015 : made a separate header file from adenewton_d.cpp,
  into adenewton_d.h, for use in the adepath_d in ../Lib.
  Did the same of adeonepath_d and ademanypaths_d,
  and also for {adenewton,adeonepath,ademanypaths}_{dd,qd}.

Mon 24 Aug 2015 : fixed bugs in adeonepath_dd.cpp and ademanypaths_dd.cpp,
  mainly due to forgotten adjustments to calls to dobldobl functions.
  Made the quad double analogues for algorithmic differentiation:
  adenewton_qd.cpp, adeonepath_qd.cpp, ademanypaths_qd, called in
  quaddobl_algodiffeval_trackers, and tested in ts_adepath_qd.

Sun 23 Aug 2015 : dobldobl_algodiffeval_trackers calls the c++ code to
  perform Newton's method and to track paths with algorithmic differentiation
  in double double precision.  The c++ code is in adenewton_dd,
  adeonepath_dd, and ademanypaths_dd, with test program in ts_adepath_dd.

Sat 22 Aug 2015 : new package standard_algodiffeval_trackers, called by
  ts_adepath_d, and calling the c++ code adenewton_d, adeonepath_d, and
  ademanypaths_d to execute the c++ code only on the host (not the device).

Fri 21 Aug 2015 : changed menu to prompt for mode in ts_gpupath_{d,dd,qd}.adb,
  added verbose option to the GPU path tracker in gpumanypaths_{d,dd,qd}.cpp.
  Also added verbose option in the call to the GPU path tracker for one path
  in gpuonepath_{d,dd,qd}.cpp.  In the calls to the GPU path tracker,
  we must explicitly give a one and a zero before the verbose option.

Thu 20 Aug 2015 : extended gpumanypaths_d.cpp with code for the GPU,
  and did the same for double double and quad double versions,
  in the files gpumanypaths_dd.cpp and gpumanypaths_qd.cpp.
  New package standard_accelerated_trackers collects the wrappers in
  the ts_gpu*_d.adb test programs, called by ts_gpupath_d.adb.
  One small change in the name of the 'track' function in gpumanypaths_d.cpp
  was needed to avoid a naming conflict with gpuonepath_d.cpp.
  Similarly, new packages {dobldobl,quaddobl}_accelerated_trackers
  are tested by ts_gpupath_dd and ts_gpupath_qd.

Wed 19 Aug 2015 : added verbose option to the instantiation of the homotopy
  in gpunewton_{d,dd,qd}.cpp and gpuonepath_{d,dd,qd}.cpp
  Also added this verbose option in gpumanypaths_d.cpp, and made the new
  versions with double doubles and quad doubles: gpumanypaths_{dd,qd}.cpp,
  called by ts_gpumanypaths_{dd,qd}.adb.

Tue 18 Aug 2015 : updates to gpuonepath_{d,dd,qd}.cpp for the new verbose
  option that has been added to the path_tracker on the host.
  Tracking many paths in double precision works, via the new
  gpumanypaths_d.cpp called by ts_gpumanypaths_d.adb.

Fri 14 Aug 2015 : fixed bug in gpuonepath_{d,dd,qd}.cpp, so the CPU version
  of the path tracker works for all precision levels.

Thu 13 Aug 2015 : new gpuonepath_dd.cpp, gpuonepath_qd.cpp, called by
  ts_gpuonepath_dd.adb and ts_gpuonepath_qd.adb respectively.

Wed 12 Aug 2015 : new ts_gpuonepath calls gpuonepath_d.cpp to track one
  solution in standard double precision, accelerated by the GPU.

Tue 11 Aug 2015 : added mode and verbose flags to gpunewton*cpp and the
  corresponding Ada ts_gpunewton*adb procedures.

Fri 7 Aug 2015 : writing of the updated solution caused changes in
  gpunewton_d.cpp and ts_gpunewton.adb.  Also modified the double double
  and quad double versions: gpunewton_dd.cpp, gpunewton_qd.cpp and the
  test programs in ts_gpunewton_dd.adb, ts_gpunewton_qd.adb.

Thu 6 Aug 2015 : updated ts_gpunewton.adb, new gpunewt_qd.cpp called by
  ts_gpunewton_qd.adb.

Tue 4 Aug 2015 : used the new ada_test_dd.h in gpunewton_dd.cpp.

Mon 3 Aug 2015 : updates in ts_gpunewton.adb, new gpunewton_dd.cpp for use
  in the new ts_gpunewton_dd.adb.

Wed 1 Jul 2015 : gpunewton_d.cpp works on the host.

Tue 30 Jun 2015 : gpunewton_d.cpp calls routines to transfer data from the
  systems and solutions containers into dedicated data structures.

Sat 27 Jun 2015 : updates to gpunewton_d.cpp, as called by ts_gpunewton.adb.

Fri 26 Jun 2015 : new file ts_gpunewton.adb to accelerate Newton's method.

Tue 1 Jul 2014 : renaming of files, separating ts_cpu from ts_gpu and
  using the ts_ only for the Ada main test programs, not for the C code.
  Made double double and quad double interfaces for random vector
  generated by Ada and 2-norm computed by the GPU.

Tue 18 Feb 2014 : renamed ts_gpu2norm_in_c.c into ts_gpu2norm_d_in_c.c
  and ts_gpu2norm.adb into ts_gpu2norm_d.adb to distinguish between the
  new double double and quad double versions.

Mon 17 Feb 2014 : callGPUnorm.cpp succeeds in having the GPU compute the
  2-norm, as called by ts_gpu2norm_Cmain.c.  Calling the GPU from an Ada
  main program works as well as is done in ts_gpu2norm_call.adb.

Thu 13 Feb 2014 : first programs ts_gpu2norm and ts_gpu2norm_in_c rely on
  the first CtoPHC/Funky interface.
