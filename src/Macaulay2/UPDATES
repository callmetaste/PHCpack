Tue 14 Oct 2015 : updated LRhomotopies.m2 for changes in phc -e.

Thu 21 May 2015 : fixed bug in mixedVolume function of PHCpack.m2 which
  was introduced with the polyhedral homotopies in double double and
  quad double arithmetic.  Needs version 2.3.97 of PHCpack.

Thu 30 Oct 2014 : updated LRhomotopies.m2 to solve general problems, tested
  R := ZZ; n := 6; m := matrix{{4, 3, 6}}; which is the [3 6]^4 problem.
  
Wed 24 Sep 2014 : fixed bug in systemFromFile in PHCpack.m2 and added
  parsing routines to LRhomotopies.m2.

Tue 23 Sep 2014 : figured out how to replace the "e+00" with regular 
  expressions when parsing systems from file.
