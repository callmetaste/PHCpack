Newton polytopes and monomial maps
==================================

The Newton polytopes of the polynomial system provide important
information about the structure of the solution sets.
The module **phcpy.polytopes** provides an interface to the convex hull
methods of PHCpack.  It also provides a directer interface to the
mixed volume calculator, directer in the sense that the user can enter
the supports directly, without having to formulate a polynomial system.

Systems that have exactly two monomials with nonzero coefficient
in every equation are called binomial systems.
Although such binomial systems are very particular,
because of their sparse structure, they can be solved much faster.
The module **phcpy.maps** provides a Python interface to the
solvers of binomial systems.

convex hulls of lattice polytopes
---------------------------------

The session below illustration the calculation of the convex hull
of a configuration of seven points in the plane.
The points are generated at random, with coordinates between -9 and +9.

::

   >>> from phcpy.polytopes import random_points as rp
   >>> from phcpy.polytopes import planar_convex_hull as pch
   >>> points = rp(2,7,-9,9)
   >>> points
   [(9, 8), (5, 6), (6, 0), (2, -5), (4, -1), (9, -4), (-1, -6)]
   >>> (vertices, normals) = pch(points)
   >>> vertices
   [(9, 8), (5, 6), (-1, -6), (9, -4)]
   >>> normals
   [(1, -2), (2, -1), (-1, 5), (-1, 0)]

The output of the convex hull method consists of a tuple of two lists.
The first list is the list of vertices.  For this particular example,
seven points were given on input, and only four of those points are 
corners of the convex hull.  The list of vertices is ordered cyclically:
two consecutive vertices span an edge of the polygon and the last and
first vertex also span an edge as a polygon has exactly as many vertices
as edges.  The second list in the output is the list of inner normals,
which are vectors perpendicular to the edges.  
Taking the inner product of the normal with the points that span an edge
yields the same value for each point on the edge, and that value is minimal
for all points in the polygon.  For the example above 
for the inner normal (1, -2) and the two points (9, 8) and (5, 6),
we have

.. math::

    9 - 2 \times 8 = 5 - 2 \times 6 = -7 

as the edge lies on the edge of the half plane defined by
the inequality

.. math::

    x_1 - 2 x_2 \geq -7

which holds for all points in the polygon spanned by the points
in the example.  The inner normals define the half planes that cut
out the polygon.

For a convex hull of a point configuration in 3-space, 
consider the example in the session below:

::

   >>> from phcpy.polytopes import random_points as rp
   >>> points = rp(3,10,-9,9)
   >>> for point in points: print(point)
   ... 
   (5, 9, -5)
   (0, 0, 1)
   (-3, -4, -1)
   (-9, -3, -3)
   (-5, 3, -8)
   (-4, 3, 7)
   (2, -3, 8)
   (9, 3, -9)
   (7, 4, -2)
   (1, -8, 1)
   >>> from phcpy.polytopes import convex_hull as ch
   >>> facets = ch(3, points)
   computed 12 facets
   >>> for facet in facets: print(facet)
   ... 
   (-597, [90, -65, -6], [4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3])
   (-84, [1, 11, 14], [4, 8, 5], [7, 11, 0])
   (-281, [30, -49, -2], [5, 1, 6], [11, 4, 0])
   (-51, [6, 5, -6], [4, 6, 7], [0, 4, 5])
   (-203, [-22, -27, -30], [6, 1, 7], [2, 9, 3])
   (-48, [5, 6, -5], [4, 7, 10], [3, 6, 7])
   (-684, [-127, 66, -29], [10, 7, 8], [5, 8, 7])
   (-150, [1, 22, 25], [4, 10, 8], [5, 6, 1])
   (-315, [-59, 15, -19], [7, 9, 8], [9, 10, 6])
   (-265, [-29, -35, -39], [7, 1, 9], [4, 10, 8])
   (-165, [-19, -10, -4], [1, 8, 9], [11, 8, 9])
   (-429, [3, -26, 42], [5, 8, 1], [1, 10, 2])

The output of the ``convex_hull`` function returns a list of facets.
Each facet is represented as a tuple of four items.
The first number is the value of the inner product of the vector
perpendicular to the facet, given by the list in the second item
of the tuple.  So the first two items in the tuple define the
half space defined by the facet.  For the first facet, we have
the inequality defined by the number -597 and the vector [90, -65, -6]:

.. math::

   90 x_1 - 65 x_2 - 6 x_3 \geq -597

which holds for all points \ :math:`(x_1, x_2, x_3)` in the convex hull.  
The equality \ :math:`90 x_1 - 65 x_2 - 6 x_3 = -597` holds
for all points that lie on the first facet in the list of facets above.
The third item in the representation of a facet is the list of numbers
to the points that span the facet.  In the example above, the first
facet is spanned by the points 4, 5, 6 in the input list points.
Note that the counting of the points starts at one and not at zero.
The last item in the representation of a facet is the list of 
facets that are adjacent to the facet.  For the first facet,
facets 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent to it.  The counting of the facets
starts at zero, so the first facet has label zero.

From the list of facets we can extract all vertex points.
If we continue with the session from above:

::

   >>> vertices = []
   >>> for facet in facets:
   ...     for point in facet[2]:
   ...         if not point in vertices:
   ...             vertices.append(point)
   ... 
   >>> vertices
   [4, 5, 6, 8, 1, 7, 10, 9]
   >>> len(vertices)
   8

We have 8 vertices and 12 facets.  The points the span the facets are
ordered cyclically so that two consecutive points span an edge and the
last and first point span also an edge.  Every edge lies in the intersection
of exactly two facets.  Edges of adjacent facets are ordered in opposite
order.  For example, facet 0 is spanned by [4, 5, 6] and its adjacent
facet 1 is spanned by [4, 8, 5], with the edge shared between both of
them oriented from 4 to 5 in facet 0 and from 5 to 4 in facet 1.

As the points in the configuration were generated sufficiently at
random, the polytope is simplicial: every facet is spanned by exactly
3 points and has exactly 3 edges.  As every edge is shared by exactly
two facets we count every edge twice if we multiply the number of facets
by three, so we have 36/2 = 18 edges.

mixed volumes
-------------

The mixed volume of a tuple of Newton polytopes
if defined as the coefficient in the expansion of the volume
of a linear combination of Newton polytopes.
For example, for a 3-tuple of Newton polytopes:

.. math::

    \begin{array}{rcl}
      vol(\lambda_1 P_1 + \lambda_2 P_2 + \lambda_3 P_3)  
      & = & V(P_1, P_1, P_1) \lambda_1^3 \\
      & + & V(P_1, P_1, P_2) \lambda_1^2 \lambda_2 \\
      & + & V(P_1, P_2, P_2) \lambda_1 \lambda_2^2 \\
      & + & V(P_1, P_2, P_3) \lambda_1 \lambda_2 \lambda_3 \\
      & + & V(P_2, P_2, P_2) \lambda_2^3 \\
      & + & V(P_2, P_2, P_3) \lambda_2^2 \lambda_3 \\
      & + & V(P_2, P_3, P_3) \lambda_2 \lambda_3^2 \\
      & + & V(P_3, P_3, P_3) \lambda_3^3
    \end{array}

where \ :math:`vol(\cdot)` is the volume function
and \ :math:`V(\cdot)` is the mixed volume.
For the tuple \ :math:`(P_1, P_2, P_3)`, its mixed volume
is \ :math:`V(P_1,P_2,P_3)` in the expansion above.

The function ``mixed_volume`` expects two arguments.
The first argument is the list of exponents of
the \ :math:`\lambda` variables in the volume expansion formula.
The second argument of ``mixed_volume`` is a tuple of Newton polytopes.
The session below illustrates the computation of the volume of one
single polytope.

::

   >>> from phcpy.polytopes import random_points as rp
   >>> from phcpy.polytopes import mixed_volume as mv
   >>> p1 = rp(3, 5, -9, 9)
   >>> p1
   [(3, 7, -3), (-1, 0, 8), (-6, -6, 8), (-6, 9, 4), (-3, 4, -7)]
   >>> tp1 = tuple([p1])
   >>> mv([3], tp1)
   2107

The volume is normalized, so the standard unit simplex has volume one.
To compute mixed volumes of two polytopes, we continue the session,
generating another polytope:

::

   >>> p2 = rp(3, 5, -9, 9)
   >>> mv([2, 1],(p1, p2))
   3910
   >>> mv([1, 2],(p1, p2))
   3961

solving binomial systems
------------------------

The irreducible components of
positive dimensional solution sets of binomial systems
have coordinates that can be represented by maps of monomials 
in free independent variables.  In this representation, there
are as many free variables as the dimension of the solution set.
The module ``maps`` exports a solver for binomial systems.

In the example below, we consider a simple system
of two binomials in three variables:

::

   >>> f = [ 'x**2*y - z*x;', 'x**2*z - y**2*x;' ]
   >>> from phcpy.maps import binomial_solver
   >>> from phcpy.maps import solve_binomials
   >>> maps = solve_binomials(3,f)
   >>> for map in maps: print(map)
   ... 
   ['x - 0', 'y - (1+0j)*t1**1', 'z - (1+0j)*t2**1', 'dimension = 2', 'degree = 1']
   ['x - (1+0j)*t1**1', 'y - (1+0j)*t1**2', 'z - (1+0j)*t1**3', 'dimension = 1', 'degree = 3']
   ['x - (1+0j)*t1**1', 'y - 0', 'z - 0', 'dimension = 1', 'degree = 1']

In the output above we recognize the twisted cubic,
the x-axis, and the yz-plane as the three solution sets.
