Using MPI with PHCpack version 2.4.01

This directory is entirely new in release 2.2 of PHCpack,
we try to provide a parallel version of PHCpack, using MPI.
It was developed in collaboration with Yusong Wang.
Release 2.3 was extended with parallel pieri.

The parallel monodromy breakup was developed in collaboration
with Anton Leykin, release in 2.3.02, see "mpi2fac_s" and "mpi2fac_d".

Parallel polyhedral homotopies are currently under development
in collaboration with Yan Zhuang, see "mpi2cell*".

Release 2.3.06 has a first version of mpi2track, which does not
-- unlike mpi2phc_s and mpi2phc_d -- read in the entire solution
list at once, but incrementally reads and writes the solutions.
For large systems, mpi2track is recommended.

The makefile in this directory can be used to create "adatest",
which is a short sanity check on the whole compilation system.
The main program in "adatest" is compiled by the MPI compiler
with calls to object files created by the gnu-ada compiler.
Type "make adatest" to create and "mpirun -np 1 adatest" to run.

The makefile in the Objects directory of PHCpack is needed to create
the other programs.  The main program is mpi2phc.c.

The current version of mpi2phc.c is a very simple parallel path tracker:
the program reads in a target and a start system (the input file for
the start system must contain the start solutions), and distributes
the start solutions evenly among the available processors.
After the path tracking is done, the root node prints out all solutions
to screen (a redirection of output with > is recommended for large outputs).

A second version uses dynamic load balancing.  Static load balancing
works well if all paths require the same amount of time, while dynamic
load balancing is good when there is a large variation in the time it
takes to trace paths.

The parallel subsystem-by-subsystem solver was developed in
collaboration in Yun Guan.
