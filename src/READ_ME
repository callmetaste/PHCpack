The date of the latest major release 2.3 was Independence Day 2005 (4 July).
Since then, releases occurred frequently, applying agile software development.
For each release, a single one line description gives a title to the release.
While 2.4 could be viewed as another major release, marking it as 2.4.00
simply continues the process of frequent releases.
