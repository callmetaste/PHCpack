Wed 19 Aug 2015 : extended write_sols of ada_test_{dd,qd}.cpp.

Tue 18 Aug 2015 : extended write_sols of ada_test.cpp so that all solutions
  of the PolySolSet are appended to the solution container.

Mon 17 Aug 2015 : reformatted mgs_test.h and mgs_test.cpp.
  Updated ada_test.h, ada_test_dd.h, and ada_test_qd.h for the new
  polysol.h and polysol.cpp, with the definitions of the PolySolSet class.

Sun 16 Aug 2015 : reformatted path_multi_test.h, path_multi_test.cpp,

Tue 11 Aug 2015 : added verbose parameter to ada_test, ada_test_dd, and
  ada_test_qd, documented in header file and implemented in .cpp file.

Fri 7 Aug 2015 : added write_sols function to ada_test to write the updated
  solution into the solutions container.  Did the same for the double double
  and the quad double versions in ada_test_dd and ada_test_qd.

Thu 6 Aug 2015 : bug fix in ada_test_qd.cpp.

Wed 5 Aug 2015 : number of symbols should be determined first when
  allocating space for the string of symbols in ada_test.cpp and 
  ada_test_dd.cpp.  Fixed passing of coefficients in ada_test_dd.cpp.
  New ada_test_qd.h and ada_test_qd.cpp for quad doubles.

Tue 4 Aug 2015 : new ada_test_dd.h and ada_test_dd.cpp for double doubles.

Tue 30 Jun 2015 : moved the adainit() and adafile() from ada_test.cpp
