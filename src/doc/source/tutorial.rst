A short tutorial
================

This section provides a quick getting started guide.

Downloading and installing
--------------------------
Executable versions of the program for various machine architectures
and operating systems are available via
<http://www.math.uic.edu/~jan/download.html>.

For :index:`Windows` operating systems, the 
executable version of phc is in the file ``phc.exe``
and is available for download in its uncompressed format.
Using the plain version of phc on a Windows system 
requires the opening of a command prompt window.

For :index:`Mac OS X` and :index:`Linux` versions, 
the executable is tarred and gzipped.
If the downloaded file is saved as ``x_phcv2_4.p.tar.gz``,
then the following commands to unzip and untar the downloaded file 
can be typed at the command prompt:

::

   gunzip x_phcv2_4p.tar.gz
   tar xpf x_phcv2_4p.tar

If all went well, typing ``./phc`` at the command prompt should bring
up the welcome message and the screen with available options.

The :index:`source code` is under :index:`version control` 
at :index:`github`,
at <https://github.com/janverschelde/PHCpack>.
To compile the source code, the gnu-ada compiler is needed.
Free binary versions of the :index:`gnu-ada compiler`
are available at <http://libre.adacore.com>.
The directory ``Objects`` in the
source code provides makefiles for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows
operating systems.

Input formats
-------------

A lot of examples are contained in the database of Demo systems,
which can be downloaded in zipped and tarred format from the above
web site.

The input file starts with the number of equations and (optionally,
but necessary in case of an unequal number) the number of unknowns.
For example, the polynomial system of Bertrand Haas (which provided
a counterexample for the conjecture of Koushnirenko) is represented
as follows

::

   2
     x**108 + 1.1*y**54 - 1.1*y;
     y**108 + 1.1*x**54 - 1.1*x;

For future use, we save this system in the file haas.
Observe that every polynomial terminates with a semicolon.
The exponentiation may also be denoted by a hat instead of
a double asterix. 

The :index:`forbidden symbols`
to denote names of variables are i and I, because they 
both represent the square root of -1.
Also forbidden are e and E because they are used in
the scientific notation of floating-point numbers,
like 0.01 = 1.0e-2 = 1.0E-2.

The equations defining the adjacent 2-by-2 minors of
a general 2-by-4 matrix are represented as

::

   3 8
    x11*x22 - x21*x12;
    x12*x23 - x22*x13;
    x13*x24 - x23*x14;

thus as 3 polynomials in the 8 undeterminates of a general
2-by-4 matrix.  We save this file as adjmin4.

The program also accepts polynomials in factored form,
for example,

::

   5
    (a-1)*(b-5)*(c-9)*(d-13) - 21;
    (a-2)*(b-6)*(c-10)*(f-17) - 22;
    (a-3)*(b-7)*(d-14)*(f-18) - 23;
    (a-4)*(c-11)*(d-15)*(f-19) - 24;
    (b-8)*(c-12)*(d-16)*(f-20) - 25;

is a valid input file for phc.
Note that we replaced the logical e variable by f.
We save this input in the file with name multilin.

A very simple Maple interface
-----------------------------

The software is developed for command line interactions.
Because there is no interpreter provided with PHCpack,
there are interfaces to :index:`computer algebra` systems
such as for example Maple.

From the web site mentioned above we can download the Maple procedure
run_phc and an example worksheet on how to use this procedure.
The Maple procedure requires only two arguments: the path name ending
in the name of the executable version of the program, and a list of
polynomials.  This procedure sets up the input file for phc, calls
the blackbox solver and returns the list of approximate solutions.
This list is returned in Maple format.

.. index:: Octave, MATLAB, Sage, Macaulay2, Maple

Other interfaces are PHClab (for Octave and MATLAB),
phc.py (for Sage), and PHCpack.m2 (for Macaulay 2).
These interfaces require only the executable phc to be present
in some directory contained in the execution path.
Interfaces for C and C++ programmers require the compilation
of the source code.  For Python, a shared object file needs
to exist for the particular architecture.

A diagram of the interfaces to PHCpack and phc is depicted below:

.. image:: ./honeyface.png

The interfaces PHCpack.m2, PHCmaple, PHClab, shown to the right
of the antidiagonal require only the executable version phc.
The other interfaces PHClib, PHCmpi, and phcpy are tied
to the source code.

Calling the blackbox solver
---------------------------

The blackbox solver works reasonably well to approximate all isolated
solutions of a polynomial system.  On the system we saved earlier in
the file multilin, we invoke the blackbox solver typing
at the command prompt

::

    /tmp/phc -b multilin multilin.phc

The output of the solver will be sent to the file multilin.phc.
In case the input file did not yet contain any solutions, 
the solution list will be appended to the input file.

We now explain the format of the solutions, for example, the last
solution in the list occurs in the following format:

::

   solution 44 :    start residual :  1.887E-14   #iterations : 1   success
   t :  1.00000000000000E+00   0.00000000000000E+00
   m : 1
   the solution for t :
    a :  5.50304308029581E+00  -6.13068078142107E-44
    b :  8.32523889626848E+00  -5.18918337570284E-45
    c :  1.01021324864917E+01  -1.29182202179944E-45
    d :  1.42724963260133E+01   1.38159270467025E-44
    f :  4.34451307203401E+01  -6.26380413553193E-43
   == err :  3.829E-12 = rco :  3.749E-03 = res :  2.730E-14 = real regular ==

This is the actual output of the root refiner.  As the residual
at the end of the solution path and at the start of the root refinement
is already 1.887E-14, one iteration of
Newton's method suffices to confirm the quality of the root.

The next line in the output indicates that we reached the end of
the path, at t=1, properly.  The multiplicity of the root is one,
as indicated by m = 1.  Then we see the values for the five variables,
as pairs of two floating-point numbers: the real and imaginary part of
each value.  The last line summarizes the numerical quality of the root.
The value for err is the magnitude of the last correction term
used in Newton's method.  The number for rco is an estimate for
the inverse condition number of the root.  Here this means that we are
guaranteed to have all decimal places correct, except for the last three
decimal places.  The last number represents the residual, the magnitude
of the vector evaluated at the root.

Running the program in full mode
--------------------------------

If we just type in /tmp/phc without any option, we run the program
in full mode and will pass through all the main menus.
A nice application is the verification of the counterexample of Bertrand
Haas.  We type in haas when the program asks us for the name of
the input file.  As the output may be rather large, we better save the
output file on /tmp.  As we run through all the menus, for this system,
a good choice is given by the default, so we can type in 0 to answer
every question.  At the very end, for the output format, it may be good
to type in 1 instead of 0, so we can see the progress of the program as
it adds solution after solution to the output file.

If we look at the output file for the system in multilin,
then we see that the mixed volume equals the 4-homogeneous Bezout
number.  Since polyhedral methods (e.g. to compute the mixed volume)
are computationally more expensive than the solvers based on product
homotopies, we can solve the same problem faster.
If we run the program on the system in multilin in full mode,
we can construct a multi-homogeneous homotopy as follows.
At the menu for Root Counts and Method to Construct Start Systems,
we type in 1 to select a multi-homogeneous Bezout number.
Since there are only 52 possible partitions of a set of four unknowns,
it does not take that long for the program to try all 52 partitions
and to retain that partition that yields the lowest Bezout number.
Once we have this partition, we leave the root counting menu with 0,
and construct a linear-product system typing 2 in the menu to construct
m-homogeneous start systems.  We can save the start system in the file
multilin\_start (only used for backup).
Now we continue just as before.

Running the program in toolbox mode
-----------------------------------

To avoid the preconditioning stage (scaling and reduction) we can
compute root counts and construct start systems via the option -r,
thus calling the program as phc -r.  One important submenu is
the mixed-volume computation, invoked via phc -m.

Once we created an appropriate start system, we can call the path
trackers via the option -p.  Calling the program as phc -p
is useful if we have to solve a slightly modified problem.  For instance,
suppose we change the coefficients of the system in multilin,
then we can still use multilin_start to solve the system with
modified coefficients, using the -p option.  In this way we use
a cheater's homotopy, performing a kind of coefficient-parameter
polynomial continuation.

Dealing with components of solutions
------------------------------------

Consider the system of adjacent minors, we previously saved 
as adjmin4.  We first must construct a suitable embedding
to get to a system with as many equations as unknowns.
We call phc -c and type 5 as top dimension.  The system
the program produces is saved as adjmin4e5.  The blackbox
solver has no difficulty to solve this problem and appends the
witness points to the file adjmin4e5.  To compute the
irreducible decomposition, we may use the monodromy breakup
algorithm, selecting 2 from the menu that comes up when we
can the program with the option -f.
